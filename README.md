# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes is a simple collection of recipes, including the ingredients and steps for each recipe.

This project is part of the Foundations curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).

## Phase 1 - HTML

Phase 1 focuses on creating the foundational HTML structure and content for the site.

The requirements can be found [in the lesson page on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).

### Assignment Criteria

- [x] Iteration 1: Initial structure
- [x] Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- [x] Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
- [x] Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

### What I Learned

In this early iteration, much of the HTML syntax is fairly straight-forward, and something that I was already familiar with. Still, it was great practice setting up and linking together pages, and writing alternative texts. This was also excellent practice with using Git with the terminal as opposed to through a GUI.

I also learned that it's fairly involved to make meringue-based cakes!

## Phase 2 - CSS

Phase 2 adds styling to the site.

The requirements can be found [in the lesson page on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/css-foundations).

### Assignment Criteria
