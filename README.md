This project is part of the Foundations curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).

## Phase 1 - HTML

Phase 1 focuses on creating the foundational HTML structure and content for the site.

The requirements can be found [in the lesson page on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).

### Assignment Criteria

- [x] Iteration 1: Initial structure
- [x] Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- [x] Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
- [x] Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

### What I Learned

In this early iteration, much of the HTML syntax is fairly straight-forward, and something that I was already familiar with. Still, it was great practice setting up and linking together pages, and writing alternative texts. This was also excellent practice with using Git with the terminal as opposed to through a GUI.

I also learned that it's fairly involved to make meringue-based cakes!

## Phase 2 - CSS

Phase 2 adds styling to the site.

The requirements can be found [in the lesson page on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/css-foundations).

### Assignment Criteria

- [x] Add styling using the external CSS method

### What I Learned

I tried to experiment with a few different exercises, including animations, accessibility, and flex. While I likely spent longer on this project than was intended, I feel overall pleased with the final result. There are some quirks that could likely be improved, but this was excellent practice towards cascading rules and keeping selectors organized.

Please feel free to open issues with any notes for improvement!
