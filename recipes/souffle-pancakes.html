    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>To Make the Pancakes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all the ingredients.You will also need a 12-inch non-stick frying
        pan (large enough to cook 3 pancakes at the same time) with a lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Separate the egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the
        bowl with the egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes to help with the
        meringue.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, add the milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk
        until thick and frothy.
      </li>
      <li>Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl.</li>
      <li>Whisk to combine thoroughly (do not overmix) and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with the egg whites from the
        freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now, start beating the
        egg whites with a hand mixer (you can also use a stand mixer or balloon
        whisk).
      </li>
      <li>
        When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in the
        sugar (roughly one-third at a time). Continue to whip the egg whites.
      </li>
      <li>
        The egg whites will become glossy and firm. Stop beating when you lift
        up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand straight up but the tip of
        the peak curls over onto itself. This is called medium/firm peaks (not
        stiff peaks yet).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large non-stick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat.
        Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil with a paper
        towel (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the pan
        on low heat while you combine the egg whites and egg yolk mixture in the
        next step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take one-third of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Whisk
        together (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this
        point).
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, take half of the remaining egg whites and add to the egg yolk
        mixture. Using a whisk, gently fold them in without breaking the air
        bubbles in the egg whites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, transfer the egg yolk mixture back into the remaining egg whites.
        Carefully fold the two mixtures together without breaking any air
        bubbles. Make sure to mix the batter very gently until the ingredients
        are thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep your frying pan heated to 300 ºF (150 ºC) at all times over low
        heat. Remember, each pancake gets roughly 4 small scoops of batter, and
        you will be making three pancakes. For the first pancake, place one
        scoop of batter and make a tall mound in the frying pan, using a small
        ladle or a serving spoon (that’s bigger than a regular spoon—probably
        2-3 Tbsp). Next, stack one more scoop of batter onto the first scoop
        already in the pan. Repeat for the next two pancakes, giving each
        pancake two scoops of batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        By the time all three pancakes have two scoops, the surface of the
        batter is slightly dry already. At this point, you can mound one more
        scoop on top of each pancake, keeping the batter piled up high. In the
        bowl, you should still have roughly three scoops left (if you have
        slightly more, that’s okay).
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in three empty spaces
        inside the pan, and cover with a lid. The steam from the water keeps the
        pancakes moist while they cook. Please note: The suggested time is just
        a guideline; how long you will cook the pancakes is based on the
        temperature of your frying pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 2 minutes have passed, open the lid, and add one final scoop for
        each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to
        stack the batter high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a
        little bit more. Cover with the lid and cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 6-7 minutes have passed, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY using an
        offset spatula. If the pancake is stuck, don’t touch it until it firms
        up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When
        the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Here is another set of images to show the process. Slightly pull the
        pancake to create an empty space and gently flip it over with a “rolling
        over” motion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add more water to the empty spaces in the pan and set the timer for 4-5
        minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat setting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving
        plates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the fresh whipped cream on the pancakes and top with the berries.
        Dust the pancake with confectioners’ sugar and drizzle with maple syrup.
        Enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To Make the Fresh Whipped Cream</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare an ice bath: Put ice cubes and water in a large bowl and place a
        clean and dry medium bowl on top of the ice water. Add the heavy cream
        and sugar to the medium bowl to keep them cold.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form. The cream should
        not be runny but soft, fluffy, and firm instead. Keep the whipped cream
        chilled until you're ready to serve the pancakes.
      </li>
    </ol>
