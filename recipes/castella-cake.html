    <ul>
      <li>(1/2 cup 2 tsp) Whole milk</li>
      <li>(1/2 cup 2 tsp) Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>(1 cup) All purpose flour</li>
      <li>(8 whole) Egg yolks and whites, separated</li>
      <li>(1 tsp) Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>(2/3 cup) White sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 140C.</li>
      <li>
        Combine the milk and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and
        heat until the butter has melted and the milk is just steaming.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the flour into a large bowl and pour over the hot milk and butter,
        mix until combined.
      </li>
      <li>Add the egg yolks and mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl add the egg whites and whisk until foamy.</li>
      <li>
        Add the sugar and beat on medium-low until the meringue reaches soft to
        medium peaks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/3 of the meringue to the yolk mixture and mix until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the lightened yolk mixture to the remaining meringue and gently use
        a whisk to fold the mixture until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the batter to the lined tin and place it in a larger baking
        tray filled with hot, but not boiling, water.
      </li>
      <li>Bake for 75 minutes or until the cake springs back when touched.</li>
