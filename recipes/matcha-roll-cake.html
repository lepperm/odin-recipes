    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The contrast of sweet and smooth Adzuki beans with the spongy and slightly
      bitter flavor of matcha roll cake is a deeply satisfying treat.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy it with a hot cup of tea!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Makes one 8"x12" cake.</p>
    <h4>Japanese Style Matcha Chiffon Cake</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>(60 ml) Whole fat milk</li>
      <li>(5 tsp) Matcha powder</li>
      <li>(4 whole) Egg whites</li>
      <li>(3 whole) Egg yolks</li>
      <li>(1/4 tsp) Cream of tartar</li>
      <li>(50 grams) Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>(45 grams) Cake flour</li>
      <li>(30 grams) Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>(1 tsp) Baking powder</li>
      <li>(1/4 tsp) Sea salt</li>
      <li>(40 ml) Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>(1/4 tsp) Vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Adzuki Red Bean Cream</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>(160 grams) Adzuki red bean (pre-soaked)</li>
      <li>(115 grams) Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>(1/4 tsp) Sea salt</li>
      <li>(1 tsp) Powdered gelatin</li>
      <li>(5 tsp) Water</li>
      <li>(1 cup) Whipping cream 33% M.F.</li>
      <li>(1 tbsp) Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>(1/4 tsp) Vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Adzuki Bean Cream Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak Adzuki beans in 3X the amount of water for a minimum of 1 hour or
        overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Matcha Chiffon Cake Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Line a 8 X 12" rectangular cake pan with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 F.</li>
      <li>In a small sauce pan, pour in milk, sift in matcha powder.</li>
      <li>
        Place over medium heat, keep stirring mixture until it starts to steam
        and no visible clumps of powder can be seen. Take off heat and set aside
        to cool. Do not let boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a clean and dry, non-plastic mixing bowl, whip egg whites on slow
        speed until frothy, add cream of tartar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase speed to medium, once the whites become opaque and bubble size
        have tightened up, add sugar a little bit at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase speed to med-high, whip until stiff peaks. You've now made a
        meringue.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, sift in cake flour, sugar, baking powder and
        salt. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a well in the center. Inside it, add yolks, oil, vanilla extract
        and the now cooled matcha milk mixture.
      </li>
      <li>Stir to combine until fully incorporated, do not over mix.</li>
      <li>
        Gently fold 1/3 of the meringue into the milk-flour mixture to get it
        moving. Once incorporated, fold in the rest of the meringue. Do not
        stir. Use batter immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter into lined cake pan from one spot, spread out the batter
        evenly with an angled spatula.
      </li>
      <li>Tap the pan on the counter to release large air pockets.</li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10-12 min. at 325 F until a skewer pulls out clean and cake
        springs back in the center.
      </li>
      <li>Let cool 5 min. in the pan before removing.</li>
      <li>Place cooling rack over cake pan.</li>
      <li>Flip cake over onto the rack, gently remove paper.</li>
      <li>
        The side facing up will eventually become the top of the cake roll. Let
        it sit on cooling rack for 5 min.
      </li>
      <li>Place a new piece of parchment paper on top of the cake.</li>
      <li>
        Flip the cake over and start rolling, allowing the parchment paper to be
        in between the folds. This will prevent the cake from sticking to
        itself. It's important to roll the cake before it cools completely,
        otherwise, it will crack while rolling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it cool in this wrapped condition while making the fresh cream.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Adzuki bean cream Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Refrigerate mixing bowl and beaters in the fridge for a minimum of 15
        minutes. This will help cream whip better.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse pre-soaked beans to rid of any impurities and throw away damaged
        beans
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in medium sized pot. Add enough water to go past the beans by 2
        inches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a medium high heat, bring water to a boil, then reduce to low for
        a light simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        LRefrigerate mixing bowl and beaters in the fridge for a minimum of 15
        minutes. This will help cream whip better.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse pre-soaked beans to rid of any impurities and throw away damaged
        beans
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in medium sized pot. Add enough water to go past the beans by 2
        inches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a medium high heat, bring water to a boil, then reduce to low for
        a light simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let beans simmer until it becomes soft, about 30 minutes (time will
        depend on how long it was pre-soaked).
      </li>
      <li>Pour beans into a colander to drain water.</li>
      <li>
        Add beans back into pot, add sugar and salt and stir on low heat until
        the water has evaporated and a line can be drawn in the beans with a
        spatula without disappearing.
      </li>
      <li>Set aside to let cool.</li>
      <li>
        Place water in a heatproof cup and sprinkle gelatin on top to bloom.
        Wait 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cup in a small sauce pan filled with simmering water. Once gelatin
        becomes liquid, take it out of the water. Let cool on the counter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately start beating the cream and sugar in a stand mixer fitted
        with the chilled bowl. Whip on low speed and then increase to medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check on the gelatin. It should no longer be warm but still runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the beaters leave tracks in the cream, pour the gelatin into the
        bowl slowly and steadily. Aim for the area in between the whisk and the
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Stop beating once the cream turns stiff. Do not over whip.</li>
      <li>Check that the beans have completely cooled off.</li>
      <li>
        Mash half of the azuki beans into a paste with a potato masher or
        pulverize it in the food processor to make a paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold in the cooled Adzuki bean paste and whole beans into the
        whipped cream.
      </li>
      <li>Use cream to assemble the cooled cake immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gently unwrap rolled cake and spread an even layer of cream on it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully roll up the cake from the short edge using the parchment paper
        to help push the cake onto itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to set before cutting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before serving, cut off sides for a cleaner presentation. Matcha cake
        roll can be kept in the fridge in an air tight container for 2-3 days.
      </li>
    </ol>
